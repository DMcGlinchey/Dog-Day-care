Background

The project is to develop a dog-care website for a client, to promote the business and educate clients and potential clients on 'doggy welfare' using multimedia elements and incorporating an online booking system.
The company are catering to canine care, for dogs while owners are at work or on long trips. The final requirements of the system are to determine as part of the project. Still, the initial discussion indicates that the company will require a website to inform customers of the available services. Allowing customers to book a time slot for their pets, in addition to utilising multimedia elements to educate and promote the company. The owner of the start-up company has had bad experiences with past dog kennels, having his dog return home scared and even one occasion with flees. He wants to create a company where dogs feel safe and allow customers to feel confident in sending them.

Pet Service 

In 2018 there are 9.9 million dog owners in the UK (pdsa), these owners work and have a life away from home, requiring them to find someone to look after their pet while there away. Pet owners have boosted their pet budget by nearly 75 percent, and the growth is projected to continue further (Bennet 2015). 
Not everyone has a friend or family member available to look after their pet when there away, require them to pay for care. In the UK, dog owners spending over £1.5bn a year in the Doggy day-care sector, for people to care and walk their dogs. Research from American Express has found UK dog owners spend on average of £1,252 on their pets every year. More than a quarter (26%) say that they spend a lot more than that value. Media reports suggest that staff that work at these firms can earn well over than the national average salary. (Taylor 2015)

What Is Dog Day-care?

Dog day-care is a short-term boarding service for dogs, offering care for dogs during work hours or on long trips. These organisations are primarily a pet sitting service, where staff will be taking care of multiple dogs. However, an excellent day-care ratio of staff to dogs should be enough. To ensure that all the dogs are kept safe and entertained. Most day-care offers a service where staff will take care of your dog alone, generally better for nervous dogs. Day-care typically provides a range of different play environments for dogs, including an indoor and outdoor play area. Many day-cares include well thought out facilities to keep dogs of all sort entertained. While nervous dogs may still struggle with this environment, day-care will have the staff to account for this issue, for nervous dogs (Heather, 2017).

Companies like Go For Walkies located in the northeast have expanded their range of service to look after other animals such as cats and are providing service like dog training. The company also has an excellent online process, posting messages on various social media platforms about the company. They also keep their customers updated about the services they provide, updating customers on the wellbeing of their pet. (Go For Walkies (2019))

Day-care to be successful, the owner needs to have some essential business management and organisational skill before embarking on this project. According to the small business administration, about 80 percent of new businesses fail within the first five years. Failure often a result of the owners' lack of business skills and planning. To start a new business or even a new service/product to an existing market, you need to create a business plan. The plan needs well laid out achievable steps, requiring the owner to be self-motivated and the need for hard work. 
Along with business skills, being that the companies oriented for dog care, the owner and their employees need to understand how dogs behave. Understanding their needs, beyond basic knowledge of what the dog looks like and how the employee's dog may act. There is numerous body language that dogs give to note carers about how they are feeling. These signals are something that the owner and employees need to take note of, to create the best environment for the dogs.

Php storm

The program has been designed through PHP storm, a platform that allows users to develop applications with such languages as HTML, Java, CSS and PHP. The structure of the site was entirely created through this platform with the use of each language. Using PHP storm, five HTML pages have been created, stated at the top of each page in the navigation bar. Each page is linked with the same CSS page, using the same classes for a specific area or different classes to give a unique look to the individual page. Each page uses some JavaScript for its content. JavaScript has been applied to the navigation bar to scale the bar to the device size. Pages as the index and login page use further java script to hide content behind the button to be activated.
Php is used across the site, like HTML. Php is created on its page and in some cases linked to an HTML file. These files are only visible once they have been uploaded online and can prove difficult for testing. Unlike HTML, you can't view it offline, proving tedious when testing small errors. Php is used to send data between platforms and for the login system, granting entry to a new location. These documents are used throughout the site, providing access to the database. Allows an individual to send and retrieve data from the database.
An example would be login details, through PHP, an individual would be able to create and insert their details into the database. Login, PHP checks whether the account exists or not. The feature is used for multiple systems throughout the site (phpstom,2020).


PhpMyAdmin is an open-source administration tool used for holding databases. The tool has been used for the site, having customers login details and orders stored. The tool is used as any other database, displaying the data and allows the administrator to alter it, easily able to view recent orders. The database is on Northumbria university system, using Northumbria host and login details to access. Fine for developing the site and testing, but once the site goes public, the start-up would need to transfer the database to their account (PHPMyAdmin, 2020). 

Filezilla

FileZilla is a server application allowing users to upload content online. A necessary tool for the site, data regularly uploaded for viewing and testing. Files as PHP can only be accessed with a server, viewing and testing needs to be uploaded continuously throughout the process. The application also works as a cloud base storage, once uploaded, an individual can access the data from any device that has FileZilla installed. The Northumbria university server was used for the site, using a Northumbria host, login and port. The host is only temporary, for creating and testing. Once the site is ready to be uploaded to the public, the start-up would require paying for a server or looking into developing their own. Doing so would require them to set their new host to the site, to allow updates in the future (Filezilla, 2020). 


Adobe photoshop

Adobe Photoshop is a graphic editing tool used to alter imagery. Photoshop has been used throughout the site on features as the logo and images. The tool allows the graphic to be given size that best suit the website and even alter the brightness. The logo has been created with the tool, joining several objects and giving them a consistent colour. Images and the logo have both been resized and even cropped through photoshop. To allow them to suit their position on the site (adobe,2020).


Website to be full mobile-optimised 

The website has been designed to be fully optimised for mobile use. As discussed in the literature review, the website needs to be optimised for mobile use. The site will decrease or increase to meet the device size. Features as the navigation bar and content will switch from a vertical display to a horizontal, on mobile devices. The navigation bar will become a toggle menu, appearing in the right-hand corner. Displaying three bars will appear (hamburger menu). Once clicked, a drop-down menu would appear showing the options as previously. The content doesn't merely shrink; objects are moving location and appearing above one another. The optimisation function will appear on all pages across the site, allow access to the website from any device.

Booking system

Originally the booking system was to appear on the home page. After implementation, it required a user to have signed up and logged in, to gain access to the system. Because of changes, the booking system was moved into the login system. Doing so prevent a user from booking order without creating an account. Having the booking system behind a login page allows the start-up to see who has made the order, unlike previously. The booking system is a list of questions, providing information about the users' pet, and means of the service. Once a user has finished filling out the form, it is submitted to the order page. On the order page, the user will be able to view the order they just made, either removing it or confirming the order. Once the order has been confirmed, a user can pay for the booking fee through PayPal. Followed by the order placed into a database.
    
Contact form

A contact form has been implemented to allow users to leave comments for the start-up. The feature will be useful for users who are having difficulties with the site or like to comment on the company. The feedback will further help the start-up grow and evolve, understanding areas of improvement. Once a user posts their feedback, an email will be sent to the company with users' message. 

Login form 

Login form allows a user to access their data, showing their profile information enabling them to book a service. Before login, a user is required to sign up, needing to create a username and password. The password would appear encrypted in the database to prevent data from being accessed. An alert message will appear if the users have entered an incorrect username or password. Once a user has successfully signed up, they can login in and view their data. The login system will include three-pages being: booking, orders and profile. Booking will allow users to book a service, which will be added to the order page. The order page will allow a user to monitor their order and remove if required. Finally, the profile will enable the user to monitor the information they had entered previously on the sign-up page. The login section will include a log out button, returning the user to the home page (HTML). 

Successfully signed up

Once a user has successfully signed up, an email will be sent to them, confirming their information. Displaying vital information, they had previously entered. This information will not include passwords, once they have been registered, the information will be permanently encrypted, and the start-up can never view. They're also a confirm button, once clicked it will return the user to the login page, allowing them to login and view the orders. Not clicking the confirm button will not affect a user login, but help them return to the site.

Password Encryption

When a user creates a password for their login details, displayed in the database, it will be encrypted, done to protect a user's password or information. Not originally an important aspect in earlier chapters but proved essential for protecting user information. This is done through PHP with the blowfish method, displaying a list of letters starting with number 2, creating a meaningless word. Blowfish has been chosen because it is a problematic password method of encryption, being that it is unclear the number of characters the user has entered. In the PHP script, it requires a user to have a password between 8 to 20 characters. Eight is the cut off being that anything under that number can be considered as too easy, and an attacker may find it easy to break them. A cut off 20 is to make the user's password easy to remember and prevent loss. Knowing the character size make the database entry easier, having password value declared as 20. If a user happens to enter a password that doesn't meet these requirements, an error message would appear. Stating that this password doesn't meet the requirement, requiring the user to enter another password. 

No same username

Usernames have been declared as unique, and no username can be the same. In the PHP script, it has been stated to deny any username entered if they already exist. Display an error message to the user if they happen to enter an existing account. Require the user to enter a username that doesn't currently exist. Username has also been stated in the database, as they have been declared as unique.

Purchasing
Once a user has booked a service, they are given the option to remove or purchase the order. When clicking the purchase button, they are taken to the cart page. On the cart page, the order details have been displayed with a PayPal button for purchasing and cost. Once clicked, a user is taken to PayPal, presented with payment detail and the purchase. The order is only a booking fee of £5, and plans would allow for full payment. Done so the start-up can choose their prices at a later day. PayPal is an online payment system that supports online money transfers. It is seen to be a safer way of making payment online, as the start-up would not see any of the user payment detail, but merely receive payment.
